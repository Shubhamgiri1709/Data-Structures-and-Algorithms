Data Structures and Algorithms - Manual Testing
📌 Overview
This project focuses on testing the implementation of various data structures and algorithms using manual testing techniques.
The documentation includes a test plan, test cases, bug report, test scenarios, RTM (Requirements Traceability Matrix), test summary report, and test execution report.
Introduction
This project tests the core functionalities of data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs) and 
algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, and dynamic programming) using manual testing.

The focus is on ensuring the correctness, reliability, and performance of the implementation.

📑 Project Workflow 
Test Plan
The test plan outlines the overall strategy and approach to testing the project. It includes the scope, objectives, tools, responsibilities, and test schedule.

Test Cases
Detailed test cases with input, expected output, and actual output. Each test case includes the following:

Test Case ID
Description
Preconditions
Steps to Execute
Expected Results
Actual Results
Status (Pass/Fail)
Bug Report
A record of issues found during testing. Each bug report includes:

Bug ID
Description
Steps to Reproduce
Severity
Priority
Status
Assigned To
Test Scenarios
High-level scenarios to validate the functionality of the data structures and algorithms.

RTM (Requirements Traceability Matrix)
A matrix that maps test cases to the corresponding requirements to ensure complete coverage.

Test Summary Report
Summarizes the overall testing activities, including total test cases, passed test cases, failed test cases, and unresolved defects.

Test Execution Report
Details the actual execution of test cases, including the timeline and results.

How to Run Tests
Review the test cases and scenarios from the documentation folder.
Follow the steps outlined in the test cases to execute tests manually.
Record the results in the test execution report.
